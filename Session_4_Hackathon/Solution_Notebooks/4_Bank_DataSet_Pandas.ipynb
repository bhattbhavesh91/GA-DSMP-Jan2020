However, they only accepted these abbreviations because of their popularity, preferring that patrons spell names out in full to avoid confusion.<sup id=\"cite_ref-USPS_History_16-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-USPS_History-16\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\\n</p><p>The traditional abbreviations for U.S. states and territories, widely used in mailing addresses prior to the introduction of two-letter U.S. postal abbreviations, are still commonly used for other purposes (such as <a href=\"/wiki/Legal_citation\" title=\"Legal citation\">legal citation</a>), and are still recognized (though discouraged) by the Postal Service.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\\n</p><p>Modern two-letter abbreviated codes for the states and territories originated in October 1963, with the issuance of <i>Publication 59: Abbreviations for Use with ZIP Code</i>, three months after the Post Office introduced <a href=\"/wiki/ZIP_code\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ZIP code\">ZIP codes</a> in July 1963. The purpose, rather than to standardize state abbreviations <i>per se</i>, was to make room in a line of no more than 23 characters for the city, the state, and the ZIP code.<sup id=\"cite_ref-USPS_History_16-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-USPS_History-16\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\\n</p><p>Since 1963, only one state abbreviation has changed. Originally <a href=\"/wiki/Nebraska\" title=\"Nebraska\">Nebraska</a> was \"NB\"; but, in November 1969, the Post Office changed it to \"NE\" to avoid confusion with <a href=\"/wiki/New_Brunswick\" title=\"New Brunswick\">New Brunswick</a> in Canada.<sup id=\"cite_ref-USPS_History_16-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-USPS_History-16\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\\n</p><p>The two-letter postal abbreviation system is complicated by the fact that several state names begin with the same letter (e.g., eight state names begin with <i>M</i> and eight begin with <i>N</i>, four \"New\" and two \"North\"). To avoid duplications, some abbreviations are not intuitive.\\n</p><p><span id=\"GPO\"></span>\\nPrior to 1987, when the U.S. <a href=\"/wiki/Secretary_of_Commerce\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Secretary of Commerce\">Secretary of Commerce</a> approved the two-letter codes for use in government documents,<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Government_Printing_Office\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"United States Government Printing Office\">United States Government Printing Office</a> (GPO) suggested its own set of abbreviations, with some states left unabbreviated.
